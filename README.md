# Google Foobar Challenges

## Description

This repository contains the problem statements, constraints, and my solutions
for the five challenges of Google Foobar. I received an invitation one day
while searching for the phrase "Python multithreading" in a Google Chrome tab.
Google Foobar is Google's secret talent recruitment process that invitees can
access at [https://foobar.withgoogle.com](https://foobar.withgoogle.com). More
